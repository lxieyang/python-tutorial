Python tutorial
============
This is a python tutorial repo containing several pieces of python starter code.
If you are using a Mac or a Linux machine and want to directly run your python script via Terminal, add the following to the first line of your code:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python
```
Then, run the following command in Terminal:
```
$ chmod a+x first.py
```
Then you can run the program like this:
```
$ ./first.py
```

###UTF-8
To use UTF-8, add the following to the second line (if the first is occupied by the `#!/usr/bin/env python`):
```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```
